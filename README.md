# Stock Analysis Project

In this project, I analyzed green energy stocks for Steve’s parents who are interested in investing in green energy but haven’t done a lot of research yet. Steve wanted to analyze a few green energy stocks besides the Daqo stock that his parents had already invested in. 

Initially, I analyzed the **Daily Volume** and **Yearly Return** for the Daqo stock using an Excel macro to run the analysis. One of the findings was that the Daqo stock had dropped **62.6%** in **2018**. Since Daqo wasn’t the best option for Steve’s parents, I created a macro to analyze all the stocks to find a better option. 
I reused part of the first code to do an **All Stocks Analysis** which simplified the task. 

Subsequently, Steve asked to broaden the analysis to the stock market. One of the challenges with this task is that this analysis will have a large data set, and the code I have worked with so far will unlikely perform as well. 

## VBA Challenge

Now that I was going to work with a large data set I decided to refactor the **All Stocks Analysis** code to improve time performance. The following is the first code I use to analyze
